## Crossword Generator
Tries to generates a crossword, based on a wordlist "qna_data.json" file.
- does not generate a gridstyle crossword.
- does not automatically save the canvas.

This project is meant for Nyk√∂pings Fountain House, and will be used
to create crosswords for their digital magazine and website.

## How to run / use
this project uses p5.js, so the simplest way to run is using the p5.js
web editor, here is a link to the project: [Web Editor]("https://editor.p5js.org/Roflcoffel/sketches/b54mSz94V")

go to the file assets/qna_data.json and add your own answers, click the run
button in the editor, and if you provided enough answers an image will be
generated.
