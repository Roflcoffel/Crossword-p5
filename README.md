## PROJECT IS UNFINISHED

## Crossword Generator
Tries to generates a crossword, based on a wordlist "qna_data.json" file.
- does not generate a gridstyle crossword.
- does not automatically save the canvas.

TODO:
- add a manual mode, were in the canvas one selects words and from that selection a crossword is generated.
- a way to automatically create the crossword, do not rely on the "connectBlock" function.
- add labels above vertical and horizontal words.
- add a theme at the top which also serves as a hint for the crossword.

This project is meant for Nyk√∂pings Fountain House, and will be used
to create crosswords for their digital magazine and website.

## How to run / use
this project uses p5.js, so the simplest way to run is using the p5.js
web editor, here is a link to the project: [p5.js Web Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/Roflcoffel/sketches/b54mSz94V)

go to the file assets/qna_data.json and add your own answers, click the run
button in the editor, and if you provided enough answers an image will be
generated.

to save the image, just right click the canvas and click on "Save As..."
