- does not automatically save the canvas.

This project is meant for Nyk√∂pings Fountain House, and will be used
to create crosswords for their digital magazine.

## How to run / use

web editor, here is a link to the project: [Crossword-p5 in Web Editor]("#")

button in the editor, and if you provided enough answers an image will be
generated.
